# Parity Runner

Parity Runner is a compute execution node for the PLGenesis decentralized AI and compute network. Runners execute tasks, run LLM inference, and earn token rewards for their computational contributions. This component includes built-in support for Docker containers, shell commands, and Large Language Model inference via Ollama.

## ðŸš€ Features

### ðŸ¤– LLM Inference Capabilities

- **Multi-Model Support**: Supports various LLM models (Qwen, LLaMA, Mistral, etc.)
- **Ollama Integration**: Seamless integration with Ollama for local LLM execution
- **Automatic Model Management**: Downloads and manages models automatically
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient GPU/CPU utilization for inference
- **Token Counting**: Accurate tracking of prompt and response tokens for billing

### âš¡ Compute Task Execution

- **Docker Support**: Execute arbitrary containers with resource limits
- **Shell Commands**: Run native shell scripts and commands
- **Resource Management**: CPU, memory, and timeout controls
- **Async Processing**: Non-blocking task execution with status reporting
- **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling and reporting

### ðŸ”’ Network Integration

- **Secure Registration**: Authenticate and register with the network
- **Heartbeat Monitoring**: Regular status updates to maintain online presence
- **Webhook Processing**: Real-time task notifications from the server
- **Capability Reporting**: Automatic detection and reporting of available models

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Go 1.23.0 or higher (using Go toolchain 1.24.0)
- Make
- Docker
  - Make sure the Docker daemon is running (`docker ps` to verify)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theblitlabs/parity-runner.git
cd parity-runner
```

2. Install dependencies and development tools:

```bash
make deps
make install-lint-tools  # Install code quality tools
make install-hooks      # Install git hooks for development
```

4. Configure the application:

```bash
# Copy the sample environment file
cp .env.sample .env

# Edit the .env file with your settings
# See Configuration section below for details
```

5. Install the Parity Runner globally:

```bash
make install
```

### Network Participation

1. Authenticate with your private key:

```bash
parity-runner auth --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
```

2. Stake tokens to participate in the network:

```bash
parity-runner stake --amount 10
```

3. Start the runner with LLM capabilities:

```bash
parity-runner runner --config-path .env
```

This will automatically:

- Set up Ollama with default models
- Register with the server
- Start processing tasks and LLM requests
- Begin earning rewards for completed work

That's it! You're now participating in the PLGenesis network.

### Verification (Optional)

You can verify your setup with these commands:

```bash
parity-runner balance  # Check your token balance
parity-runner help    # View all available commands
```

### Development Tools

The project includes several helpful Makefile commands for development:

```bash
make build          # Build the application
make clean          # Clean build files
make deps           # Download dependencies
make fmt            # Format code using gofumpt
make imports        # Fix imports formatting
make format         # Run all formatters (gofumpt + goimports)
make lint           # Run linting
make format-lint    # Format code and run linters
make run            # Start the task runner
make stake          # Stake tokens in the network
make balance        # Check token balances
make auth           # Authenticate with the network
make install        # Install parity-runner command globally
make uninstall      # Remove parity-runner command from system
make install-lint-tools # Install formatting and linting tools
make install-hooks  # Install git hooks
make help           # Display all available commands
```

You can get a free RPC endpoint for Filecoin Calibration from:

- [Glif.io](https://api.calibration.node.glif.io/rpc/v1) (Official)
- [ChainStack](https://chainstack.com/)
- [Ankr](https://ankr.com/)

You can specify a custom configuration path in three ways (in order of precedence):

1. Command line flag:

```bash
parity-runner --config-path=/path/to/.env
```

2. Environment variable:

```bash
export PARITY_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/.env
parity-runner
```

3. Default path:
   If neither the flag nor environment variable is set, it will use `.env` in the current directory.

## CLI Commands

The CLI provides a unified interface through the `parity-runner` command:

```bash
# Show available commands and help
parity-runner help

# Authenticate with your private key
parity auth --private-key <private-key>

# Check balance
parity-runner balance

# Stake tokens
parity-runner stake --amount <amount>

# Start a runner
parity-runner

```

Each command supports the `--help` flag for detailed usage information:
